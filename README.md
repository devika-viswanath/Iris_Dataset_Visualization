# Iris Dataset Visualizations

This project provides a comprehensive visual analysis of the **Iris dataset** using various types of plots to understand relationships between the different features (`sepal_length`, `sepal_width`, `petal_length`, and `petal_width`) and how they vary across species (`setosa`, `versicolor`, `virginica`).

---

## üìä Visualizations Included

### 1. Density Plot of Petal Length by Species
- Shows the distribution of petal length values for each species.
- Highlights clear separation between species based on petal length.

### 2. Bubble Chart: Sepal Dimensions with Petal Length as Size
- X-axis: Sepal Length  
- Y-axis: Sepal Width  
- Bubble Size: Petal Length  
- Color: Species  
- Useful for multivariate analysis combining shape, size, and species.

### 3. Box Plot of All Features
- Displays the spread and outliers of all numerical features.
- Useful to detect range and central tendency.

### 4. Box Plot of Petal Length by Species
- Shows variation in petal length for each species with median, quartiles, and outliers.

### 5. Pair Plot of Iris Dataset
- Pairwise scatter plots for all feature combinations.
- Diagonal contains KDE distributions.
- Clearly shows clusters and linear separability between species.

### 6. Histograms of Features
- Separate histograms for each feature: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
- Displays the frequency distribution of values.

### 7. Scatter Plot: Sepal Length vs Sepal Width
- Species are colored differently.
- Illustrates the relationship and spread of sepal dimensions across classes.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used is the **Iris dataset**, one of the most well-known datasets in pattern recognition. It contains 150 samples with the following features:
- `sepal_length` (cm)
- `sepal_width` (cm)
- `petal_length` (cm)
- `petal_width` (cm)
- `species` (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

## üìå How to Use
1. Clone the repo or open the notebook.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
3. Run the notebook to generate visualizations.
4. Use the plots to explore relationships, distribution, and classification potential of the dataset.
